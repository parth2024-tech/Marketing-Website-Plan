            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-8 max-w-2xl">
              Sentinel has no laptop to sell you, no service contract to upsell, no manufacturer relationship to protect. Every finding links to its trigger condition, its data source, and the OEM failure pattern it's designed to catch.
